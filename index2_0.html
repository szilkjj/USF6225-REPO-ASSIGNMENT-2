    <h2>Understanding the Opiod Epidemic Today</h2> 
        </h3>
            <p>Over the past decade, the issue of drug overdoses has become an increasingly concerning and complex public health challenge. Tragically, the number of deaths resulting from overdoses has surged, reflecting a pervasive and multifaceted crisis. The opioid epidemic, in particular, has played a significant role in this alarming trend, with both prescription and illicit opioids contributing to a substantial portion of overdose fatalities. Despite efforts to address the crisis through enhanced awareness, education, and the implementation of harm reduction strategies, the numbers remain distressingly high. The societal impact of these losses is profound, affecting individuals, families, and communities across the globe. As policymakers, healthcare professionals, and advocacy groups continue to grapple with this epidemic, there is a pressing need for comprehensive and compassionate approaches that encompass prevention, treatment, and support for those affected by substance use disorders. Addressing the root causes of the overdose crisis requires a collective commitment to public health initiatives, destigmatization of addiction, and the fostering of accessible, evidence-based interventions.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2> The purpose of explaining opioid overdoses is to raise awareness about a critical public health issue that has far-reaching consequences for individuals, families, and communities. By shedding light on the factors contributing to opioid overdoses, including the role of both prescription and illicit opioids, the aim is to foster understanding and empathy. Through education, it becomes possible to dispel misconceptions surrounding substance use disorders and the complexities associated with opioid addiction. Moreover, elucidating the gravity of the opioid overdose crisis serves as a call to action for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
            Looking into the values of overdoses per 100k people we see that for 1) Opiods, 2) Commonly Prescribed Opiods, 3) Heroin, and 4) Synthetic Opiod Analgesics have all been trending upwards in the 22 year period:
    <ul>
    <li>AGR for Any Opioid: 9.35%</li>
    <li>AGR for Commonly Prescribed Opioids: 8.51%</li>
    <li>AGR for Heroin: 11.62%</li>
    <li>AGR for Synthetic Opioid Analgesics: 17.92%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Additional Considerations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All Categories have exerience an upward trend, suggesting an overall increase in opiod usage.</li>
        <li>Synethetic Opiod Analgesics experienced the highest level of annual growth, suggesting a significant rise in synthetics.</li>
        <li>Prescribed and Any Opiod categories show relatively steady growth, while the Heroin and Synthetic Opiods show more pronounced increases in the 22 year span.</li>
        <li>As we move into the modern age where we can receive anything tomorrow, it could be stated that this is enabling accessibility to drugs and various controlled substances.</li>
